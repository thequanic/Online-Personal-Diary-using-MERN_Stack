## Objective 
To develop a full stack webportal to provide a safe, private, and secure system to share and store your personal thoughts and day life stories with anytime-anywhere accessbility.
## Motivation 
This project was started as an academic project and the sole purpose behind it was implementing and improving skillset in the area of MERN Full Stack Developement. As one of the early MERN projects by Devansh Goel (*@thequanic*), the project idea was kept simple and relatable to one's daily lifestyle. However, being academic project, does not mean the quality of the project has been compromised anywhere. It has been assumed to meet the industrial standards and the design principles were carefully implemented to provide industrial level functionalities.
## Tech Stack Used
The project is based on MERN stack that is Mongo DB, Express.js, React JS, and Node JS.
