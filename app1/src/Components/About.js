                About Project:<br/>
    My Project is to develop a secure and robust web 
    platform, which can help people to manage their personal 
    dairies online.
    I have named my project as “My Diary”. It is build using the 
    most popular stack of today: ‘MERN’ Stack.<br/><br/><br/>
    Technology/Methodology Used:<br/><br/>
    ➢ React: React is a node.js library used to develop user 
    interfaces that support single page application.
    A single page application is the one which only reloads 
    the modified component of the webpage and do not 
    perform reloading for rest of the application. This makes 
    our application efficient, robust and fast.
    React helps to develop single page application by 
    breaking the webpage into user-defined components.<br/><br/>
    ➢ Express.js: Express is a node.js framework used to 
    develop powerful restful api. It is used to build a single 
    page, multipage and hybrid web application. It’s a layer 
    built on the top of the Node.js that helps to manage 
    servers and routes<br/><br/>
    ➢Mongo DB: Mongo DB is a powerful No-SQL database 
that helps us to store data in the form of objects. It
provides enhanced security and access to our data.<br/><br/> 
➢ Node.js: Node.js is a platform that enables us to use 
javascript outside the web browsers. MERN stack is 
considered one of the powerful stacks as React, 
Express.js and Mongo DB are all based on just one 
language: javascript and can be easily used using 
node.js.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
Features of project:<br/><br/>
✓ It is fully secure as it uses powerful hashing to encrypt <br/>
password into database.<br/>
✓ It also uses json web token for user authentication.<br/>
✓ It does not convey internal information in messages.<br/>
✓ User can easily access his/her diary<br/>
✓ It uses powerful login system for authorisation<br/>
✓ I is a single-page application and thus fast, robust and
